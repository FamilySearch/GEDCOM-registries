    ```
    CHARACTER_SET:=
    [ ANSEL |UTF-8 | UNICODE | ASCII ]
    ```
    A code value that represents the character set to be used to interpret
    this data. Currently, the preferred character set is ANSEL, which includes
    ASCII as a subset. UNICODE is not widely supported by most operating
    systems; therefore, GEDCOM produced using the UNICODE character set will
    be limited in its interchangeability for a while but should eventually
    provide the international flexibility that is desired. See Chapter 3,
    starting on page 77.

    interpreted properly without knowing which code page the sender was using.
