    confidential = This data was marked as confidential by the user. In some
    systems data marked as confidential will be treated differently, for
    example, there might be an option that would stop confidential data from
    appearing on printed reports or would prevent that information from being
    exported.

  - |
    locked = Some records in Ancestral File have been satisfactorily proven by
    evidence, but because of source conflicts or incorrect traditions, there
    are repeated attempts to change this record. By arrangement, the Ancestral
    File Custodian can lock a record so that it cannot be changed without an
    agreement from the person assigned as the steward of such a record. The
    assigned steward is either the submitter listed for the record or Family
    History Support when no submitter is listed.

  - |
    privacy = Indicate that information concerning this record is not present
    due to rights of or an approved request for privacy. For example, data
    from requested downloads of the Ancestral File may have individuals marked
    with 'privacy' if they are assumed living, that is they were born within
    the last 110 years and there isn't a death date. In certain cases family
    records may also be marked with the RESN tag of privacy if either
    individual acting in the role of HUSB or WIFE is assumed living.
