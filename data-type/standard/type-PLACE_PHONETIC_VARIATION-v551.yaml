specification:
  - |
    The phonetic variation of the place name is written in the same form as
    was the place name used in the superior <PLACE_NAME> primitive, but
    phonetically written using the method indicated by the subordinate
    <PHONETIC_TYPE> value, for example if hiragana was used to provide a
    reading of a a name written in kanji, then the <PHONETIC_TYPE> value would
    indicate kana. (See <PHONETIC_TYPE> page 57.)
