    <REGISTERED_RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER>:<RECORD_IDENTIFIER>
    The record number that uniquely identifies this record within a registered
    network resource. The number will be usable as a cross-reference pointer.
    The use of the colon (:) is reserved to indicate the separation of the
    "\"registered resource identifier\" (which precedes the colon) and the unique"
    "\"record identifier\" within that resource (which follows the colon). If the"
    colon is used, implementations that check pointers should not expect to
    find a matching cross-reference identifier in the transmission but would
    find it in the indicated database within a network. Making resource files
    available to a public network is a future implementation.
