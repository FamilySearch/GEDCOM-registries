    The QUAY tag's value conveys the submitter's quantitative evaluation of
    the credibility of a piece of information, based upon its supporting
    evidence. Some systems use this feature to rank multiple conflicting
    opinions for display of most likely information first. It is not intended
    to eliminate the receiver's need to evaluate the evidence for themselves.

  - 0 = Unreliable evidence or estimated data
  - |
    1 = Questionable reliability of evidence (interviews, census, oral
    genealogies, or potential for bias for example, an autobiography)
  - 2 = Secondary evidence, data officially recorded sometime after event
  - 3 = Direct and primary evidence used, or by dominance of the evidence
