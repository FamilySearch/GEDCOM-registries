specification:
  - |
    ```
    DATE_VALUE:=
    [ <DATE> | <DATE_PERIOD> | <DATE_RANGE>| <DATE_APPROXIMATED>  | INT <DATE>
    (<DATE_PHRASE>) | (<DATE_PHRASE>) ]
    ```
  - |
    The DATE_VALUE represents the date of an activity, attribute, or event
    "where:"
  - |
    INT = Interpreted from knowledge about the associated date phrase included
    in parentheses.
  - |
    An acceptable alternative to the date phrase choice is to use one of the
    other choices such as <DATE_APPROXIMATED> choice as the DATE line value
    and then include the date phrase value as a NOTE value subordinate to the
    DATE line tag.
  - |
    The date value can take on the date form of just a date, an approximated
    date, between a date and another date, and from one date to another date.
    The preferred form of showing date imprecision, is to show, for example,
    MAY 1890 rather than ABT 12 MAY 1890. This is because limits have not been
    assigned to the precision of the prefixes such as ABT or EST.
