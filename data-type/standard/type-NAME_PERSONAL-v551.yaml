    The surname of an individual, if known, is enclosed between two slash (/)
    characters. The order of the name parts should be the order that the
    person would, by custom of their culture, have used when giving it to a
    recorder. Early versions of Personal Ancestral File (r) and other products
    did not use the trailing slash when the surname was the last element of
    the name. If part of name is illegible, that part is indicated by an
    ellipsis (...). Capitalize the name of a person or place in the
    conventional manner- capitalize the first letter of each part and
    lowercase the other letters, unless conventional usage is otherwise. For
    "example: McMurray."

  - "Examples:"
  - William Lee (given name only or surname not known)
  - /Parry/ (surname only) William Lee /Parry/
  - William Lee /Mac Parry/ (both parts (Mac and Parry) are surname parts
  - William /Lee/ Parry (surname imbedded in the name string)
  - William Lee /Pa.../
