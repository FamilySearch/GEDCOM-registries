standard tag: 'ROMN'

specification:
  - A romanized variation of a superior text string.
  - The romanized variation of the place name is written in the same form prescribed for the place name used in the superior <PLACE_NAME> context. The method used to romanize the name is indicated by the line_value of the subordinate <ROMANIZED_TYPE>, for example if romaji was used to provide a reading of a place name written in kanji, then the <ROMANIZED_TYPE> subordinate to the ROMN tag would indicate 'romaji'. (See <ROMANIZED_TYPE> page 61.)
