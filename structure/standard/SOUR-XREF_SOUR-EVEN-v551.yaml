specification:

    Pertaining to a noteworthy happening related to an individual, a group, or
    an organization. An EVENt structure is usually qualified or classified by
    a subordinate use of the TYPE tag.
  - |
    A code that indicates the type of event which was responsible for the
    source entry being recorded. For example, if the entry was created to
    record a birth of a child, then the type would be BIRT regardless of the
    assertions made from that record, such as the mother's name or mother's
    birth date. This will allow a prioritized best view choice and a
    determination of the certainty associated with the source used in
    asserting the cited fact.
