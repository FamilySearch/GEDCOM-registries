standard tag: 'EVEN'

specification:
  - |
    Pertaining to a noteworthy happening related to an individual, a group, or
    an organization. An EVENt structure is usually qualified or classified by
    a subordinate use of the TYPE tag.
  - |
    A code that indicates the type of event which was responsible for the
    source entry being recorded. For example, if the entry was created to
    record a birth of a child, then the type would be BIRT regardless of the
    assertions made from that record, such as the mother's name or mother's
    birth date. This will allow a prioritized best view choice and a
    determination of the certainty associated with the source used in
    asserting the cited fact.

    ```
    [ <EVENT_TYPE_INDIVIDUAL> | <EVENT_TYPE_FAMILY>  | <ATTRIBUTE_TYPE> ]
    ```
    A code that classifies the principal event or happening that caused the
    source record entry to be created. If the event or attribute doesn't
    translate to one of these tag codes, then a user supplied value is
    expected and will be generally classified in the category of other.
