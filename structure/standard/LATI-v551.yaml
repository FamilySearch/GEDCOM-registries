specification:
  - A value indicating a coordinate position on a line, plane, or space.
  - "The value specifying the latitudinal coordinate of the place name. The latitude coordinate is the direction North or South from the equator in degrees and fraction of degrees carried out to give the desired accuracy. For example: 18 degrees, 9 minutes, and 3.4 seconds North would be formatted as N18.150944. Minutes and seconds are converted by dividing the minutes value by 60 and the seconds value by 3600 and adding the results together. This sum becomes the fractional part of the degree's value."
