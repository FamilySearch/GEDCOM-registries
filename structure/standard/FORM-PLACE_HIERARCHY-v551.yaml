specification:
  - |
    An assigned name given to a consistent format in which information can be
    conveyed.
  - |
    This shows the jurisdictional entities that are named in a sequence from
    the lowest to the highest jurisdiction. The jurisdictions are separated by
    commas, and any jurisdiction's name that is missing is still accounted for
    by a comma. When a PLAC.FORM structure is included in the HEADER of a
    GEDCOM transmission, it implies that all place names follow this
    jurisdictional format and each jurisdiction is accounted for by a comma,
    whether the name is known or not. When the PLAC.FORM is subordinate to an
    event, it temporarily overrides the implications made by the PLAC.FORM
    structure stated in the HEADER. This usage is not common and, therefore,
    not encouraged. It should only be used when a system has over-structured
    its place-names.
