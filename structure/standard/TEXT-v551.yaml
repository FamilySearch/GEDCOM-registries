specification:
  - The exact wording found in an original source document.
  - |
    A verbatim copy of any description contained within the source. This
    indicates notes or text that are actually contained in the source
    document, not the submitter's opinion about the source. This should be,
    "from the evidence point of view, \"what the original record keeper said\" as"
    opposed to the researcher's interpretation. The word TEXT, in this case,
    means from the text which appeared in the source record including labels.
