standard tag: 'TEXT'

specification:
  - The exact wording found in an original source document.
  - |
    A verbatim copy of any description contained within the source. This indicates notes or text that are
    actually contained in the source document, not the submitter's opinion about the source. This should
    be, from the evidence point of view, "what the original record keeper said" as opposed to the
    researcher's interpretation. The word TEXT, in this case, means from the text which appeared in the
    source record including labels.
