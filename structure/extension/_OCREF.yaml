specification:
  - Occurrence Reference
  - |
    A reference from an individual or family to an occurrence record (_OCUR).
    This structure contains all participant-specific data such as role, age,
    and participation details.
    
    In the container-only model (v0.2.0+), all participant data is stored
    exclusively in _OCREF structures to avoid data duplication and synchronization
    issues.
