specification:
  - Association Type
  - |
    Specifies the type of association or relationship beyond the standard ROLE.
    This provides more specific categorization of the relationship between
    two individuals.
    
    Unlike ROLE which uses a controlled vocabulary, TYPE allows free-text
    description to accommodate various relationship types across cultures
    and time periods.
    
    Examples:
    - "Godparent" (with ROLE "Godfather" or "Godmother")
    - "Business Partnership" (with ROLE "Business Partner")
    - "Military Service" (with ROLE "Fellow Soldier")
    - "Childhood Friend" (with ROLE "Friend")
    - "Neighbor" (with ROLE "Neighbor")
