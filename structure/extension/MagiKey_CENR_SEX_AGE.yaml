specification:
  - Age
  - |
    The age of a set of individuals in a head-of-household census.
    If the age range cannot be expressed by an `AGE` structure,
    an `_AGER` substructure is used to refine the range.
    An `NCHI` substructure is used to hold the count of relevant
    individuals in the indicated age range.

    The payload is identical to the standard AGE structure, but the set
    of substructures is extension-defined.
