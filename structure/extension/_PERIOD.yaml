specification:
  - Date Period Container
  - |
    Container structure for defining the time boundaries of any dateable item.
    Allows specification of when something began and/or ended using full
    GEDCOM 7 Date syntax (including ranges and approximations).
    
    Either START or END may be omitted if unknown. If both are omitted,
    the PERIOD structure should not be used.
    
    This structure can be used with any context that needs to express
    a time period with explicit start and/or end dates, not limited to
    associations.
    
    Examples in ASSO context:
    - Godparent relationship: START at baptism, END at ward's majority
    - Employment: START date of hire, END date of termination
    - Military service: START at enlistment, END at discharge
    - Friendship: May have only START if still ongoing
    
    Could also be used with other contexts like:
    - Residence periods
    - Educational enrollments
    - Memberships
    - Any time-bounded relationship or status
