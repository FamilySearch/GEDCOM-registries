specification:
  - Occurrence Participant
  - |
    A reference to an individual or family who participated in an occurrence.
    This structure is used within _OCUR records to list all participants.
    The actual participation details (role, age, etc.) are stored in the
    participant's _OCREF structure, not here.
    
    This design maintains a clean separation between occurrence data and
    participant-specific data.
