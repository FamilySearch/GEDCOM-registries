specification:
- Evidence Container
- 'An _EVID record represents a piece of evidence as an independent object,

  separate from any specific conclusion or individual. This allows "floating

  evidence" that can be associated with multiple potential individuals or

  left unassociated until identity can be determined.


  Evidence containers preserve original source information exactly as found,

  including names, dates, places, and relationships, without forcing premature

  identity conclusions. This solves the "Which John Smith?" problem by allowing

  evidence to exist independently until research determines the correct association.'
