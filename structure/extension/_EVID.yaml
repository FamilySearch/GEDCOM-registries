specification:
  - Evidence Container Record
  - |
    A record representing a piece of evidence as an independent object.
    Evidence records preserve source information exactly as found, including
    names, dates, places, and relationships, without forcing premature 
    identity conclusions. This enables "floating evidence" that can be
    associated with multiple potential individuals or left unassociated
    until identity can be determined through research.
