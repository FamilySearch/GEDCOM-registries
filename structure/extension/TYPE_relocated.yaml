# This relocates the standard TYPE structure to ASSO context
# No custom extension tag needed - uses standard TYPE

specification:
  - Association Type
  - |
    Uses the standard GEDCOM 7 TYPE structure relocated to the ASSO context.
    This provides a user-defined classification or type of the association
    to supplement the ROLE value.
    
    TYPE provides free-text description to accommodate various relationship
    types across cultures and time periods, while ROLE provides the
    standardized relationship term.
    
    Examples:
    - TYPE "Godparent" with ROLE "GODP"
    - TYPE "Business Partnership" with ROLE "OTHER"
    - TYPE "Military Service" with ROLE "OTHER"
    - TYPE "Childhood Friend" with ROLE "FRIEND"
    - TYPE "Next-door Neighbor" with ROLE "NGHBR"
    
    This approach reuses the standard TYPE structure, maintaining
    consistency with how TYPE is used elsewhere in GEDCOM 7.
