specification:
  - Association Confidence
  - |
    Indicates the confidence level in the association assertion.
    Uses the standard GEDCOM 7 QUAY (quality) enumeration:
    
    0 = Unreliable evidence or estimated data
    1 = Questionable reliability of evidence  
    2 = Secondary evidence, data probably reliable
    3 = Direct source, primary evidence, data considered reliable
    4 = Well-supported conclusion from primary evidence
    
    This reuses the standard QUAY enumeration for consistency with
    GEDCOM 7 and to benefit from existing language translations.
    
    Examples:
    - 4: Business partnership documented in legal records
    - 3: Godparent relationship from church baptism record
    - 1: Possible sibling based on census proximity and ages
    - 0: Family legend of relationship, no documentation
