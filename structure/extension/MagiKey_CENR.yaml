specification:
  - Census Record
  - |
    A pointer to a census record that can be shared by multiple individuals.
    Typically this structure is used under a `CENS` event, but it can also
    be used under other structures for individual events or attributes recorded
    in the census record, where it is semantically similar to `SOUR`, but points
    to a census record rather than a source record.
