    This structure is intended to be the GEDCOM 7 parallel of the GEDOCM-X
    element http://gedcomx.org/v1/NamePart

    The preferred order of name-part structures is the preferred display order
    of the name parts.
  - |
    To be fully interoperable with other parts of GEDCOM 7, applications should
    impose the following limitations on users. For the purpose of these
    limitations, a set of name parts are said to be contiguous if, after
    removing any hidden parts, they are adjacent in the list of name parts.

    *   Some applications (and some governments; see, e.g.
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufname) require at most one primary
        given name. This means that if there is more than one part with
        qualifier Primary and type Given, all such parts must be contiguous.

        In most cases, a single Primary Given part is adequate, but there may
        be cases when additional details (such as particles, root names, etc)
        will be added about parts of the primary given name, necessitating
        breaking it up into several parts.

    *   The g7:type-Name datatype requires at most one primary surname, as
        identified by slashes in the payload. This means that

        *   If there is more than one part with qualifier Primary and type
            Surname, all such parts must be contiguous.

        *   If there is no part with Primary and type Surname, then all
            parts with type Surname must be contiguous.

        In some cases a single Primary Surname part is adequate, but there
        may be cases when additional details (such as particles, root names,
        etc.) will be added about parts of the primary surname name,
        necessitating breaking it up into several parts.
  - |
    It is intended that name-part be used in such a way that all other elements
    of a g7:INDI-NAME or g7:NAME-TRAN can be reconstructed unambiguously from
    the name-parts alone. To achieve this, every character in the name's
    displayed form should be in a name-part. This may mean there are name-parts
    with no type or qualifier that store spacing, punctuation, etc.

    To populate the other name data from name parts,

    * Create the g7:type-NAME payload by

        1.  Concatenating all name-part payloads that do not have the hidden
            qualifier.
        2.  Removing any U+002F characters (slash or solidus, /), which
            g7:type-NAME cannot represent.
        3.  Possibly delimit a part of the string with slashes:
            -   If no part has type Surname, do not add slashes.
            -   Otherwise, if there are name parts with type Surname and
                qualifier Primary, put a slash before the first such part and
                after the last such part.
            -   Otherwise, if there are parts with type Surname, put a slash
                before the first such part and after the last such part.

    *   Create other personal name parts as follows:
        -   Create a g7:GIVN for each part with type Given
        -   Create a g7:SURN for each part with type Surname, unless it also
            has qualifier Particle and precedes all Surnames that lack Particle:
            in that case, use g7:SPFX instead
        -   Create a g7:NPFX for each part with type Prefix
        -   Create a g7:NSFX for each part with type Suffix
        -   Create a g7:NICK for each part with qualifier Familiar that does
            not also have a type
        -   If using a rufname extension, create a rufname structure for the
            concatenated sequence of parts with type Given and qualifier Primary
