extension tags: ['_AGER']

specification:
  - Age at event
  - |
    The age range of the individual at the time an event occurred
    in the form Integer-Integer.  Example: the value 16-26 means
    that the person was at least 16 years old and less than 26 years
    old at the time of the event.  This differs from the `AGE`
    structure which can only express an upper or lower bound, but not
    both.  Typically the `AGE` structure can only appear once per
    superstructure and so two bounds cannot be used under the same
    superstructure using any standard mechanism.
  - |
    An `_AGER` is only permitted as a substructure of an `AGE`
    structure with a bound in years that matches one end of the
    `_AGER` payload.
