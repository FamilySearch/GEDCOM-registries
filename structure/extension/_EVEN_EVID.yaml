specification:
  - Evidence Event
  - |
    An event representing the discovery or analysis of evidence directly
    related to this individual. Unlike floating evidence records, evidence
    events are intrinsically tied to the person and represent findings
    that are definitively about this individual. Use this for evidence
    that doesn't need to "float" between potential matches.
