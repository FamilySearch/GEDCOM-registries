  - _NP_TYPE

specification:
  - |
    The type of a name part. Only four name part types are defined, and not all
    name parts need have a type. Additional, more specific name part
    descriptors can be found in the name-part-qualifier.

    This structure is intended to be the GEDCOM 7 parallel of the type property
    of the GEDOCM-X element http://gedcomx.org/v1/NamePart. The payload of this
    structure should be an enumerated value documented by GEDCOM-X for that
    property.

    The name-part-type structure is optional, and should only be included if
    exactly one of the enumerated values correctly describes the name part.
