specification:
  - Occurrence Record
  - |
    An _OCUR record represents an occurrence as an independent, first-class object
    that can involve multiple participants with different roles. This allows
    the same occurrence (such as a census, burial, or ceremony) to be referenced
    by multiple people without duplication of occurrence data.
    
    Unlike embedded events (EVEN) in INDI or FAM records, _OCUR records exist at
    the top level and are referenced using _OCREF from participants.
    
    This extension addresses the synchronization problems that occur when multiple
    people participate in the same event, providing a clean separation between
    event data (date, place, type) and participation data (role, age).
