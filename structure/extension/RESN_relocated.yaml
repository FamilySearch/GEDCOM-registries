# This relocates the standard RESN structure to ASSO context
# No custom extension tag needed - uses standard RESN

specification:
  - Association Privacy Restriction
  - |
    Uses the standard GEDCOM 7 RESN (restriction) structure relocated
    to the ASSO context. This indicates privacy or access restrictions
    for this specific association.
    
    Standard RESN values apply:
    - CONFIDENTIAL: This association is confidential
    - LOCKED: This association should not be changed
    - PRIVACY: This association should be treated as private
    
    Applications should respect these restrictions by:
    - Excluding restricted associations from public reports
    - Requiring additional authentication to view
    - Preventing changes to LOCKED associations
    
    This approach reuses the standard RESN structure and enumeration,
    providing consistency with existing GEDCOM 7 privacy mechanisms.
